# You are given two fuses. Each one burns for exactly one minute, but not uniformly, so one cannot 
# predict exactly how much of the fuse will be left after a given amount of time. You are allowed to 
# light one or more unlit ends of any fuse, but only at time t = 0 or when a fuse burns out completely. 
# How do you measure 45 seconds? 

# The solution is to light both ends of one fuse and one end of the other fuse at the same time. When
# the first fuse burns out completely, 30 seconds have passed â€” then light the remaining end of the 
# other fuse. Forty-five seconds will have passed when this fuse burns out.

# From this problem, a fast-growing function arises. This program is a python implementation.
